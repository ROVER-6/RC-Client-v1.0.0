## Welcome to Rover Client!

We provide the quickest, easiest, safest and overpowering hacking client of 2021. However, it is in beta and you will need access to the beta from the creator. You can still download Rover Client via the github.io page however you will be unable to login. The code IS obfuscated so do not try cracking RC!

### Src

Where is the src? We don't have a source, due to people potentially pirating RC! We may sell source code to our client yet we are considering it.
